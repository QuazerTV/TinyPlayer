        - Note: Avoid to put the onPlaybackPositionUpdated closure inside Nimble's waitUntil(:) closure!
        The reason is that onPlaybackPositionUpdated will get called at a 60fps rate, this causes issue when 
        unblocking the mainthread after the done() declaration within Nimble. Doing so will potentially cause 
        Nimble to throw an exception about calling done() too many times.

        - Parameter timepoint: A timepoint at which the action closure get executed.
