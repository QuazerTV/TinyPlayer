        Capture a set of still images from the current media asset in its original resolution by giving a set of
        timepoints. The image capture only takes place in the valid time span. If the one of specified timepoints is
        out of bounds, TinyVideoPlayer will try to performe the action at the closest position. If the video duration
        is not known yet, TinyVideoPlayer will instead try to capture the very first frame of the video.
     
        - Parameter timepoints: A set of timepoint within the valid playable timespan at which TinyVideoPlayer will
            capture a still image from the video sequence. If you let it empty, then the currentPlayback time will
            be used.
        - Parameter completion: A closure that will be called after the image capture is done. The final result
            will be passed in as a closure parameter. This closure will be called once per valid timepoint.
        - Parameter time: The timepoint for which the image is captured.
        - Parameter image: The captured image. Or nil if the capture was failed.
     
        - Note: This method takes advantage of the AVAsset class and it won't work with HLS videos.
        Use captureStillImageForHLSMediaItem(:) for HLS videos instead. The completion closure will be called on
        the main thread!
